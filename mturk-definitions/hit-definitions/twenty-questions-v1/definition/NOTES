This batch of HITs comes from the allenai/crowdsense repo.

In order to run this HIT you must follow these steps:

  1. Deploy the crowdsense webapp to crowdsense.allenai.org.
  2. To get the Turkers to play the game at the same time, post a 'Sign
     Up HIT' that Turkers simply fill out saying they're interested in
     playing the game.
  3. Assign a special qualification to all the Turkers that did the sign
     up HIT and require that qualification on this batch of HITs.
  4. Email the Turkers telling them that they must play the game as soon
     as they accept the HIT and giving them the time at which you'll
     post the HITs.
  5. Finally, post the HITs at the specified time.
